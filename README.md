# 2nd Eddy Cross Disciplinary Symposium Parallel Session
## An end-to-end approach for predicting the geoeffectiveness of solar coronal mass ejections
#### 8th June 2021

This hands-on workshop is focused on an end to end project for binary classification using neural networks, in an attempt to predict the geoeffectiveness of solar coronal mass ejections (CMEs). Problem-specific challenges, like class imbalance, will be exemplified and discussed together with approaches to overcoming them. Moreover, some efficient and human-friendly techniques of analyzing and visualizing both data and models' performance will be presented.
